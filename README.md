# Control-System-Approximation

**Problem statement:** 

Treating a control system as a black-box we need to approximate the input-output relationship using **Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)** and **Radial Basis Function Networks(RBFNs).**

Refer to [Project Report](https://github.com/anupamkhandelwal/Control-System-Approximation/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf) for detailed description.
